Question A: Enter two lines and it will give the output 'overlap' or 'no overlap'
            It accepts only integer values.
 
Question B: Enter two string values. It compares the values and returns whether value 1 is greater, lesser or equal to string 2.
            It can accept only integer or float values.
            Test cases:
              value1: 1  value2:1 ('First value is equal to Second value')
              value1: 2  value2:4 ('First value is lesser than Second value')
              value1:1.5 value2:0.6 ('First value is greater than Second value')
              value1: abc value2:5db (Error is thrown)
              value1: whitespace  value2: whitespace  (Error is thrown)
              value1: null value2:null (Error is thrown)
              
              
              
Question C: 5 values are given as input and the output shows that only the last 3 values are stored and the older values (cache) 
            are deleted.
